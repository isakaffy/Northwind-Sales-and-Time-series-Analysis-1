ðŸ“ˆ Time Series Forecasting & Power BI Dashboard â€“ Northwind Datase
Project Overview

This project focuses on performing time series analysis on the Northwind dataset using Python-based statistical modelsâ€”ARIMA, Moving Average, and Exponential Smoothingâ€”to forecast future sales trends. Additionally, a Power BI dashboard was created to visualize and analyze key customer insights, specifically identifying the Top 10 Customers by Total Sales.

 Objective
	â€¢	To analyze historical sales data and build accurate forecasting models.
	â€¢	To compare different time series models and evaluate performance.
	â€¢	To visualize top customers and their contributions to revenue through an interactive dashboard.

 Dataset Description

The dataset was sourced from the Northwind Traders sample database. Key tables used:
	â€¢	Orders
	â€¢	Order_Details
	â€¢	Customers
	â€¢	Products

Preprocessing involved:
	â€¢	Merging multiple tables
	â€¢	Aggregating sales over time (monthly)
	â€¢	Handling missing values and setting a time index

 Time Series Models Applied

 Moving Average
	â€¢	Used to smoothen short-term fluctuations and highlight longer-term trends or cycles.
	â€¢	Visualized using rolling mean and standard deviation.

 Exponential Smoothing (Simple & Holt-Winters)
	â€¢	Weighted moving average model that gives more weight to recent observations.
	â€¢	Models both trend and seasonality (Holt-Winters).

 ARIMA (Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average)
	â€¢	Selected after performing ADF (Augmented Dickey-Fuller) Test and analyzing ACF/PACF plots.
	â€¢	Parameters (p, d, q) were optimized using grid search and AIC evaluation.
	â€¢	Residual diagnostics confirmed model adequacy.

 Model Evaluation
	â€¢	Performance Metrics: MAE, RMSE
	â€¢	Compared actual vs. forecasted values
	â€¢	Visual inspection of residuals for randomness

 Power BI Dashboard

Dashboard Insights:
	â€¢	Top 10 Customers by Total Sales
	â€¢	Region/Country-wise breakdown
	â€¢	Sales Trends (Monthly)
	â€¢	Customer Contribution % to Total Revenue

Features:
	â€¢	Interactive filters
	â€¢	Dynamic charts and KPIs
	â€¢	Clean and business-friendly visuals

 Key Takeaways
	â€¢	ARIMA gave the most accurate forecasts based on RMSE and residual analysis.
	â€¢	Power BI dashboard provided quick business insight on top revenue-generating customers.
	â€¢	This combination of statistical modeling and BI visualization supports better decision-making.

 Future Improvements
	â€¢	Automate model selection using Auto-ARIMA
	â€¢	Deploy dashboard using Power BI service or Flask (for web)
	â€¢	Extend model to include exogenous variables (e.g., promotions)
